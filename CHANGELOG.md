## [0.0.1] - 2025-07-06

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed path traversal vulnerability in `DefaultAssetResolver.calculateFileHash()` method
- Added comprehensive input validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Implemented secure path validation that detects various attack patterns:
  - Basic traversal sequences: `../`, `..\\`, `..`
  - URL-encoded variants: `%2e%2e/`, `%2e%2e\\`, `%2e%2e`
  - Double-encoded patterns: `%252f`, `%255c`
  - Complex bypass attempts: `....//`, `....\\`
- Added invalid character filtering to block dangerous characters:
  - Null bytes (`\0`) and control characters (`\r`, `\n`)
  - File system unsafe characters (`<`, `>`, `"`, `|`, `?`, `*`)
- Implemented absolute path prevention for Windows/Unix systems
- Added early validation at entry point with clear error messages

### Changed
- `DefaultAssetResolver.resolve()` now validates all input paths and throws `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid paths
- Enhanced security posture by rejecting malicious inputs instead of silent failures
- Updated Spring Boot from 3.4.2 to 3.4.7 (security updates)
- Updated logback-classic from 1.5.16 to 1.5.18 (vulnerability fix)
- Updated JUnit Jupiter from 5.11.4 to 5.13.3
- Updated Mockito from 5.15.2 to 5.18.0

### Technical Details
- Added `isValidAssetPath()` method for comprehensive path validation
- Added `containsPathTraversalSequences()` method to detect various traversal patterns
- Added `containsInvalidCharacters()` method to filter dangerous characters
- Added `hasValidFileExtension()` method with whitelist of approved file extensions
- Added `securePathResolution()` method for safe path normalization
- Added `isPathContainedWithin()` method to verify paths stay within allowed directories
- Added configurable `assetBasePath` property to replace hardcoded paths
- Added comprehensive security logging for all validation failures
- Added `DefaultAssetResolverSecurityTest` with 50+ security test cases
- All validation happens before any file system operations

## [0.0.2] - 2025-07-07

### Fixed
- **Build Failures**:
    - Resolved `NullPointerException` and `AssertionError` in `DefaultAssetResolverTest` by:
        - Creating dummy asset files (`image.jpg`, `test.css`) in `core/src/test/resources/static`.
        - Correcting `properties.getLocalPath()` stubbing in `shouldAddVersionHashWhenEnabled()` to use a web-root relative path (`/assets`).
        - Adding `properties.getAssetBasePath()` stub in `shouldAddVersionHashWhenEnabled()` to correctly resolve file system paths.
        - Refactoring `calculateFileHash` in `DefaultAssetResolver.java` to correctly convert web-facing paths to file system paths.
    - Addressed `AssertionError` in `DefaultAssetResolverSecurityTest`'s `shouldRejectAbsolutePaths` by:
        - Refining `isValidAssetPath` in `DefaultAssetResolver.java` to explicitly reject common Unix-like absolute system paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/bin/`).
        - Removing the problematic `securePathResolution(path) == null` check from `DefaultAssetResolver.resolve`.
        - Importing `java.nio.file.InvalidPathException` in `DefaultAssetResolver.java`.
- **Test Stability**:
    - Eliminated `UnnecessaryStubbingException` errors in `DefaultAssetResolverSecurityTest` by:
        - Refactoring `DefaultAssetResolverSecurityTest` to use a mocked `AssetProperties` with minimal `setUp` stubs.
        - Removing redundant `when().thenReturn()` stubs from individual test methods (`shouldAllowValidAssetPaths`, `shouldAllowPathsWithoutExtensions`, `shouldAllowValidPathsWithSpaces`, `shouldWorkWithLocalPathConfiguration`).
        - Converting `assertThatThrownBy` assertions to `try-catch` blocks with `Assertions.fail()` for more robust exception testing.
    - Fixed compilation errors in `DefaultAssetResolverSecurityTest` by correctly escaping backslashes in `@ValueSource` annotations.
    - Enabled standard stream logging for Gradle tests in `core/build.gradle` to aid debugging.
