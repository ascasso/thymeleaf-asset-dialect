# Thymeleaf Asset Dialect (TAD) Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enables or disables the asset dialect.
# When "true", the dialect will process `tad:src` and `tad:href` attributes.
# When "false", the dialect is disabled, and the attributes will be ignored.
tad.enabled=true

# The base path where your local static assets are served from.
# This path is prefixed to the asset paths specified in your templates.
# For example, an asset at `tad:href="/css/styles.css"` will be looked for
# in the `src/main/resources/static/css/styles.css` directory.
tad.local-path=/static

# The base URL for your Content Delivery Network (CDN).
# When this property is set, the dialect will generate CDN URLs for your assets
# instead of local paths. This is typically used in production environments.
# Example: tad.cdn-url=https://my-cdn.com/assets
#
# To test CDN functionality, uncomment the following line:
# tad.cdn-url=//my-test-cdn.com
