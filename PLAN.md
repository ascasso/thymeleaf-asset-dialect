# Development Plan

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Thymeleaf Asset Dialect project, here is the recommended implementation plan organized by priority:

## Phase 1: Critical Security & Stability (High Priority)

### âœ… Security Improvements (COMPLETED)
1. **Path traversal vulnerability protection** - Input validation and sanitization implemented in `DefaultAssetResolver.java:isValidAssetPath()`
2. **Comprehensive security testing** - `DefaultAssetResolverSecurityTest.java` covers all attack vectors
3. **Input validation** - CDN URLs, asset paths, and configuration validation in place
4. **File extension whitelisting** - Only approved web asset extensions allowed

### âœ… Configuration & Error Handling (COMPLETED)
1. **Environment-aware file resolution** - Configurable paths with `assetBasePath` property
2. **Exception handling** - Proper logging and error recovery implemented
3. **Security monitoring** - All violations logged for auditing

## Phase 2: Architecture & Performance (Medium Priority)

### ðŸ”„ Performance Optimization (RECOMMENDED)

#### Caching Layer Implementation
The current implementation calculates file hashes on every request, which is resource-intensive. Implement a caching layer to address this:

1. **In-Memory Cache**:
   - Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe hash storage
   - Consider [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) for advanced features (eviction policies, size/time-based expiration)

2. **Optimized File Hashing**:
   - Read files in chunks rather than loading entire files into memory
   - Reduce memory consumption for large files

3. **Configuration Properties**:
   ```properties
   tad.caching.enabled=true
   tad.caching.max-size=1000
   tad.caching.expire-after-write=1h
   ```

#### Comprehensive Test Plan for Caching
- **Cache Hit/Miss Tests**: Verify hash calculation occurs only once per file
- **Configuration Tests**: Ensure caching can be disabled
- **Concurrency Tests**: Thread-safe cache access with `CountDownLatch` and `ExecutorService`
- **Edge Cases**: Non-existent files, cache invalidation
- **Performance Tests**: Measure improvement with cached vs non-cached requests

### ðŸ”„ Architecture Improvements (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Strategy Pattern**: Implement for version strategies (hash vs timestamp)
2. **Single Responsibility**: Refactor `DefaultAssetResolver` to separate concerns
3. **Enhanced Integration Tests**: Cover security scenarios and edge cases

## Phase 3: Features & Documentation (Lower Priority)

### ðŸ“‹ Feature Enhancements
1. **Asset Bundling**: Combine multiple assets for optimization
2. **Monitoring Integration**: Metrics for cache hit rates, resolution times
3. **Developer Tools**: Configuration validation and debugging utilities

### ðŸ“š Documentation
1. **Usage Examples**: Complete template integration examples
2. **Performance Tuning**: Caching configuration guidelines
3. **Security Best Practices**: Deployment and monitoring recommendations

## Implementation Notes

- **Security-First**: All improvements maintain existing security protections
- **Backward Compatibility**: Configuration changes should be additive
- **Test Coverage**: Each feature requires comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Performance**: Caching implementation should show measurable improvement in high-traffic scenarios

## Current Status

The project demonstrates excellent security practices with comprehensive protection against path traversal attacks and proper input validation. The main opportunity for improvement is performance optimization through intelligent caching of file hash calculations.
